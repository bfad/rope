Creating and Running a Rope App
===============================
In this section, you will learn how to create a Rope application and run the 
built-in web server for development. All examples will assume that you have
successfully installed Rope and that you have set up your ``PATH`` environment
variable so that you don't have to specify the full path to the Rope script.


Creating a New Project
----------------------
To create a new Rope application, open a terminal and change to the directory
you want to create the new project in and issue the ``rope new <NAME>`` command
or the short-cut ``rope n <NAME>`` command. Ex::

   $> cd ~/projects/
   $> rope new do_list

The above example will create a directory named "do_list" in the projects
directory in your home folder. That new directory will contain the basic file
and directory layout for your Rope application.

Project Directory Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rope is meant to be very flexible, so it's default folder structure doesn't try
and impose any architectural model on your project. Below is a list of the
folders that are created and a description of what they are used for.

lasso_home/
   This is the Lasso instance home folder for your application. When you run the
   built-in web server, it sets this as your LASSO9_HOME environment variable.

views/
   This is a special folder used with ``rope->include`` that allows for it to be
   the default root instead of your webroot. This allows your webroot to contain
   no Lasso code if you desire.

webapp/
   This is the directory where you will probably keep all your business logic.
   This folder is actually symbolically linked as the LassoStartup folder in the
   lasso_home directory.

webroot/
   This is the webroot for your web application. Stick all your javascript, css,
   and other assets in here.


Running the Built-in Web Server
-------------------------------
To run your Rope application, change your working directory to the top-level of
your Rope application and then issue the ``rope server`` or ``rope s`` command.
Ex::

   $> cd ~/projects/do_list
   $> rope s

This starts the built-in web server and loads your Rope application. While this
web server is suitable for development work, you should look into deploying your
application with a dedicated web server such as Apache or Nginx. (See the
instructions on :doc:`deploying Rope applications <deploy>` for details.)


Using Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Rope has the concept of running in different environments. You may want to be
able to set things up that work one way while testing, another while developing,
and another when in production. For example, you may want to differentiate the
database each environment connects to by appending to the database name an
underscore and the name of the environment. Or, you may want your tests to run
quickly, so you set up your password hashing to only run the hash method once
instead of the thousands of times for production.

In the places where you want to configure your code to work differently
depending on the environment, use the ``rope->env`` method to retrieve the
current environment and use boolean constructs to run the appropriate code. The
default environment in 'dev', and this can be changed by setting a ``ROPE_ENV``
environmental variable to the desired value. This can be done when running rope
via the command-line on OS X or Linux like so::

   ROPE_ENV=test rope s

The above sets the value produced by ``rope->env`` to "test". If running via the
Instance Manager, it allows for adding the environment variable using its web
interface.

The following example has the ``db_name`` method return a different value
depending on the environment that has been setup::

   define db_name => `database` + '_' + rope->env
